This is tutorial of GPU programing in python+reikna. The code was written with jupyter notebook. 

Q1.Why wrote with jupyer notebook but no normal code?

Because jupyer notebook is interactive environment that make this tutorial easy learn.

Q2.Why reikna?

Also there are vast python libs support GPU computing but most of them is only for CUDA not OpenCl. Code with reikna can run both two environments with only one line change.

Q3.Do we really need code things ourselves?

Yes, for example specialist things. Moveover, GPU computing is very easy to code nowaday.
